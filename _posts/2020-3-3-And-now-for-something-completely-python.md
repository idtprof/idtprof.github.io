There's been plenty of discussion in one of my classes about Python programming -- what it is, where to learn it and what to use to get started. After suggesting several resources to some of my students, I remembered an old post in a previous blog where I listed several links to pertinent sites, and while some are still valuable, many of them are showing their age (this was back in the v2 days).
