## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## Semantic Elements

Semantic HTML elements clearly describe itâ€™s meaning in a human and machine readable way. Elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<article>` are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.

## HTML Layouts

- `<header>` - Defines a header for a document or a section
- `<nav>` - Defines a container for navigation links
- `<section>` - Defines a section in a document
- `<article>` - Defines an independent self-contained article
- `<aside>` - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- `<footer>` - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- `<details>` - Defines additional details
- `<summary>` - Defines a heading for the `<details>` element
